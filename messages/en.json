          "question": "How does the Shopify theme detector work?",
          "answer": "Our detector analyzes the HTML structure, JavaScript, and CSS of any Shopify store to identify theme-specific patterns and metadata. It cross-references this information with our comprehensive database of official Shopify themes to provide accurate identification."
        },

          "question": "Is this tool completely free to use?",
          "answer": "Yes! Our Shopify theme detector is 100% free with no hidden costs, registration requirements, or usage limits. You can detect unlimited themes without any restrictions."
        },
        "item-3": {
          "question": "How accurate is the theme detection?",
          "answer": "Our detection algorithm has a 99.9% accuracy rate for official Shopify themes. For custom themes, we can still identify if a store is using Shopify and provide relevant information about the store structure."
        },
        "item-4": {
          "question": "What types of Shopify stores can I analyze?",
          "answer": "You can analyze any Shopify store, including those with custom domains (like store.com) and myshopify.com subdomains. Our tool works with stores from all countries and markets."
        },
        "item-5": {
          "question": "What information do I get about the detected theme?",
          "answer": "You'll receive the theme name, whether it's an official or custom theme, theme store ID (if applicable), direct links to the Shopify theme store, and pricing information for official themes."
        },
        "item-6": {
          "question": "Can you detect custom or modified themes?",
          "answer": "While we excel at identifying official Shopify themes, we can also detect when a store uses a custom theme or heavily modified official theme. In these cases, we'll indicate it as a 'Custom Theme' and provide what information is available."
        },
        "item-7": {
          "question": "Why does detection sometimes fail?",
          "answer": "Detection may fail if the website is not a Shopify store, if the store has heavy customizations that obscure theme identifiers, or if the store is password-protected or has restricted access."
        },
        "item-8": {
          "question": "Do you store or track the URLs I analyze?",
          "answer": "No, we don't store or track any URLs you analyze. Each detection is processed in real-time and no data is saved on our servers, ensuring your privacy and the privacy of the stores you analyze."
