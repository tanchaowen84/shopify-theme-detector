          "question": "How does the Shopify theme detector work?",
          "answer": "Our detector analyzes the HTML structure, JavaScript, and CSS of any Shopify store to identify theme-specific patterns and metadata. It cross-references this information with our comprehensive database of official Shopify themes to provide accurate identification."
        },

          "question": "Is this tool completely free to use?",
          "answer": "Yes! Our Shopify theme detector is 100% free with no hidden costs, registration requirements, or usage limits. You can detect unlimited themes without any restrictions."
        },
        "item-3": {
          "question": "How accurate is the Shopify Theme Detector?",
          "answer": "Our Shopify Theme Detector is designed to deliver reliable and consistent results by analyzing the Shopify.theme object directly from the store’s HTML. While results may vary depending on whether a store uses an official, custom, or modified theme, the detector performs especially well with themes built using standard Shopify architecture. For custom setups, we still provide clear insight into the Shopify structure and theme usage."
        },
        "item-4": {
          "question": "What types of Shopify stores can I analyze?",
          "answer": "You can analyze any Shopify store, including those with custom domains (like store.com) and myshopify.com subdomains. Our tool works with stores from all countries and markets."
        },
        "item-5": {
          "question": "What information do I get about the detected theme?",
          "answer": "You'll receive the theme name, whether it's an official or custom theme, theme store ID (if applicable), direct links to the Shopify theme store, and pricing information for official themes."
        },
        "item-6": {
          "question": "Can you detect custom or modified themes?",
          "answer": "While we excel at identifying official Shopify themes, we can also detect when a store uses a custom theme or heavily modified official theme. In these cases, we'll indicate it as a 'Custom Theme' and provide what information is available."
        },
        "item-7": {
          "question": "Why does detection sometimes fail?",
          "answer": "Detection may fail if the website is not a Shopify store, if the store has heavy customizations that obscure theme identifiers, or if the store is password-protected or has restricted access."
        },
        "item-8": {
          "question": "Do you store or track the URLs I analyze?",
          "answer": "No, we don't store or track any URLs you analyze. Each detection is processed in real-time and no data is saved on our servers, ensuring your privacy and the privacy of the stores you analyze."
        },
        "item-9": {
          "question": "Can I use this for competitive research?",
